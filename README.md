# jtrVAE

The source code for the *j-tr*VAE paper will be released soon. In the meanwhile, please checkout our [pyroVED package](https://github.com/ziatdinovmax/pyroVED), which has a simplified version of the *j-tr*VAE, together with multiple other variational encoder-decoder models for applications in image and spectral analyses.
